					  <p>The game is played on a map <var>width</var> tiles wide and <var>height</var> tiles high, with [<const>0</const>, <const>0</const>] point being located in top-left corner. Each tile can only be occupied by one entity at a time - entities are defined as non-empty tiles: <b>units</b> and <b>buildings</b> owned by each player, but also <b>neutral tiles</b> like mines or walls.</p>
					  
					  <p>At the beginning of each turn players get a list of every entity on the map and information of their <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> position, <var>owner</var> identifier, <var>entityType</var> and <var>health</var>.</p>
					  
					  <p>Each player starts with certain amount of <b>resources</b>, that can also be found on the map and need to be <b>harvested</b>. Those resources can be used for creation of different buildings and units.</p>

					  <p><b>Orders</b> given by players have to be written according the rules and order syntax. Incorrect orders will result in immediate elimination of the player. If an order fits the criteria, but it's not possible to be executed, because of external reasons (like different unit blocking the way) - it will fail, without player's elimination. Every entity owned by players has only specific orders it can execute. All actions can be done in all 8 directions. Entity is only limited by the free space, other entities, its own <var>reach</var> and size of its <var>step</var>.</p>
					  
					  <p>Entities can only <b>move</b> into empty tiles or the tiles that will be emptied the same turn (for example, if occupied by a different unit owned by the player, that will also move the same turn). Otherwise, the order will fail to be executed, without eliminating the player.</p>
					  
					  <p>Entity tiles can be classified based on their owner and type:</p>

					  <span>Neutral tiles</span>
				  </h3>
				  <div style="margin-bottom: 10px">
					  <p>Neutral tiles have owner identifier value equal to <const>-1</const>. There are three types of those entities in this variant of the game:</p>
					  <ul>
						  <li>
							  <b>Walls</b> - they are the main physical obstacle in the arena. They are <b>unbreakable</b>, which means their base health is equal to <const>-1</const>.
						  </li>
						  <li>
							  <b>Gold Mines</b> - source of <b>Gold</b>. Their health value represents the amount of resource left to be mined. When depleted, it disappears from the arena.
						  </li>
						  <li>
							  <b>Forests</b> - source of <b>Wood</b>. Their health value represents the amount of resource left to be logged. When depleted, it disappears from the arena.
						  </li>
					  </ul>
				  </div>
				  
				  <h3 style="font-size: 14px;font-weight: 700;padding-top: 15px;color: #838891;padding-bottom: 15px;">
					  <span>Buildings</span>
				  </h3>
				  <div style="margin-bottom: 10px">
					  <p>Buildings are part of player tiles so their <var>owner</var> corresponds to the player's ID (player = <const>0</const>, enemy = <const>1</const>). They can't <b>move</b> or <b>attack</b>, but they can <b>train</b> (i.e. create) units in the range of their <var>reach</var>. Usually much more costly to be built than other entities.</p>
					  <ul>
						  <li>
							  <b>Castles</b> - pivotal building for each player. The player who doesn't have any castles left loses. They can train <b>Workers</b>.
						  </li>
						  <li>
							  <b>Barracks</b> - training ground for more advanced units. Can train units like <b>Light</b>, <b>Heavy</b> and <b>Ranged</b> troops.
						  </li>
					  </ul>
				  </div>
				  
				  <h3 style="font-size: 14px;font-weight: 700;padding-top: 15px;color: #838891;padding-bottom: 15px;">
					  <span>Units</span>
				  </h3>
				  <div style="margin-bottom: 10px">
					  <p>Units are the more dynamic player tiles akin to chess pieces. All of them can <b>move</b> at the speed of <var>step</var> tiles per turn. They can also do all the given actions in the range of their <var>reach</var>.</p>
					  <ul>
						  <li>
							  <b>Workers</b> - most universal unit. Their main functionality is to <b>build</b> and <b>harvest</b> resources. They can <b>attack</b>, but they aren't very durable, strong or fast, their range is also only limited to one tile.
						  </li>
						  <li>
							  <b>Light</b> - more advanced combat unit. They are more durable and stronger than regular Workers. Their main characteristic is that they can move two tiles per turn.
						  </li>
						  <li>
							  <b>Heavy</b> - the tank unit. Strongest and most durable unit in the game. They are more costly to produce.
						  </li>
						  <li>
							  <b>Ranged</b> - weak, long range unit. Their main characteristic is long attack range of three tiles.
						  </li>
					  </ul>

					  <p>Each turn players sent one line consisting of semi-colon separated orders. Then referee checks their validity and then commits them in priority order of: building > training > moving > harvesting > attacking.</p>
					  <p>Any movement that can't be done immediately is then pushed to the end of the "move" queue, this repeats until the queue is empty or no more units can move. After "moving" phase any remaining "building" or "training" orders that weren't possible before, will be considered once again.</p>
					  <p>Conflicting orders are executed in random order, if not possible to be executed at the same time. In case of two units attacking each other - both of them get damaged.</p>
					  <p>Then referee cleans any defeated entities and depleted resources off the arena and checks, if any of the end conditions are met.</p>
